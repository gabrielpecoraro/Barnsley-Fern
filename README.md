# Barnsley Fern Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on generating the **Barnsley Fern fractal** using the **C programming language**. The algorithm utilizes recursive and iterative approaches to render the fractal efficiently. This project was developed as part of the **IF112 module on image processing**.

## Features
- **Fractal generation** using recursive and optimized iterative methods
- **Customizable parameters** for controlling the fractalâ€™s complexity
- **Pixel manipulation functions** for accurate rendering
- **Performance analysis** of different algorithmic approaches

## Required Software
To work with this project, you will need:
- **GCC Compiler** (for compiling the C code)
- **Make** (optional, for building automation)
- **Image viewer** that supports **PPM format** (e.g., GIMP, IrfanView)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd barnsley-fern
   ```
2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc -o barnsley barnsley.c -lm
   ```
3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./barnsley
   ```
4. View the output image (`fern.ppm`) using an image viewer that supports PPM format.
